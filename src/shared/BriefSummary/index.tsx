            <h1>Hi, I&apos;m Mukesh, Welcome...!</h1>
            <p>
                I am a Full Stack Developer with around 4 years of experience in building scalable, high-performance web
                applications. I specialize in React for front-end development and Spring Boot Microservices for the
                backend, ensuring seamless integration and optimal user experiences. Currently, I am working as a Full
                Stack Application Development Engineer at Unisys, where I lead a team of 6 developers, delivering
                complex projects on time and with precision.
            </p>
            <p>
                My professional journey has spanned diverse domains, where I&apos;ve honed my skills in designing and
                developing full-stack applications. I have a proven track record of migrating legacy systems to modern
                architectures, improving code efficiency with best practices like Checkstyle, and enhancing application
                performance through optimization techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                I take pride in my ability to not only code but also to lead and mentor teams, ensuring smooth project
                deliveries. I have been recognized as the Best Employee for on-time delivery and innovative
                contributions in my projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my technical expertise, Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, staying updated with
                the latest trends in cloud solutions like AWS (EC2, S3), and ensuring quality through unit testing and
                CI/CD pipelines.
